# About ðŸ“–
 Books is a polyglot microservices-based demo application that illustrates the use of [CF Container Networking](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/netman-release).

 The [demo application](https://www.amalgam8.io/docs/demo/bookinfo/), [sidecar](https://www.amalgam8.io/docs/sidecar) and Service Discovery / Routing [control plane](https://www.amalgam8.io/docs/control-plane) are based on [Amalgam8](https://www.amalgam8.io/).

 The application is comprised of 4 microservices: [Products](https://github.com/amalgam8/amalgam8/tree/master/examples/apps/bookinfo/productpage), [Details](https://github.com/amalgam8/amalgam8/tree/master/examples/apps/bookinfo/details), [Reviews](https://github.com/amalgam8/amalgam8/tree/master/examples/apps/bookinfo/reviews) and [Ratings](https://github.com/amalgam8/amalgam8/tree/master/examples/apps/bookinfo/ratings).
 - The products microservice talks to reviews and details
 - The reviews microservice talks to ratings

About this demo app:
- has a single external route for products page (i.e. [http://books-products.bosh-lite.com](http://books-products.bosh-lite.com/productpage?u=normal))
- all other microservices (details, reviews and ratings) communication and policy enforcement will be on the internal overlay [CF Container Network](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/netman-release)
- CF apps are deployed as [Docker](https://docker.com) containers and leverage a [sidecar](https://www.amalgam8.io/docs/sidecar) inside the container that handles service discovery, health checks and routing requests to other microservices
- amalgam8 control plane (service registry / controller) are not deployed with auth enabled, please see [a8 docs](https://www.amalgam8.io/docs/sidecar/sidecar-configuration-options) for more info.

Below is a visual of what parts of the product page are comprised of the various microservices.

# Prerequisites
- [CF](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release) deployment
- [Diego](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release) deployment
  - [Docker support](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-design-notes/blob/master/docker-support.md) enabled
  - [Netman support](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/netman-release) enabled
- [cf cli](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli)
  - [netman network policy ](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/netman-release/releases) cf cli plugin installed

# Configuration
The scripts in this example use [cf.cfg](./cf.cfg) to configure CF domains, app names, etc.
If you wish to use the scripts to deploy the demo apps, please change the values to match your target environment.
The defaults assume [bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) and that you already are targeting a org and space.

# Deployment

## Deploy Amalgam8 Controller and Registry
```sh
./scripts/deploy-a8.sh
```

You should now see the amalgam8 controller and registry apps running:
```sh
$ cf apps
Getting apps in org demo / space demo as admin...
OK

name               requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
books-controller   started           1/1         256M     1G     books-controller.bosh-lite.com
books-registry     started           1/1         256M     1G     books-registry.bosh-lite.com
```


## Deploy Products app

You may either run this script:
```sh
./scripts/deploy-products.sh
```

OR if you wish to deploy by hand
```sh
cf push books-products -o amalgam8/a8-examples-bookinfo-productpage-sidecar:v1 --no-start
cf set-env books-products A8_SERVICE "products:v1"
cf set-env books-products A8_ENDPOINT_PORT "9080"
cf set-env books-products A8_ENDPOINT_TYPE "http"
cf set-env books-products A8_PROXY "true"
cf set-env books-products A8_REGISTER "true"
cf set-env books-products A8_REGISTRY_URL "http://registry.bosh-lite.com"
cf set-env books-products A8_CONTROLLER_URL "http://controller.bosh-lite.com"
cf start books-products
```

## Deploy Book Details app

You may either run this script:
```sh
./scripts/deploy-details.sh
```

OR if you wish to deploy by hand
```sh
cf push books-details -o amalgam8/a8-examples-bookinfo-details-sidecar:v1 --no-start --no-route
cf set-env books-details A8_SERVICE "details:v1"
cf set-env books-details A8_ENDPOINT_PORT "9080"
cf set-env books-details A8_ENDPOINT_TYPE "http"
cf set-env books-details A8_PROXY "true"
cf set-env books-details A8_REGISTER "true"
cf set-env books-details A8_REGISTRY_URL "http://registry.bosh-lite.com"
cf set-env books-details A8_CONTROLLER_URL "http://controller.bosh-lite.com"
cf start books-details
```

Allow the Products app the ability to talk to the Details app:
```sh
cf access-allow books-products books-details --port 9080 --protocol tcp
```

## Deploy Book Reviews app

You may either run this script:
```sh
./scripts/deploy-reviews.sh
```

OR if you wish to deploy by hand
```sh
cf push books-reviews -o amalgam8/a8-examples-bookinfo-reviews-sidecar:v3 --no-start --no-route -u none
cf set-env books-reviews A8_SERVICE "reviews:v3"
cf set-env books-reviews A8_ENDPOINT_PORT "9080"
cf set-env books-reviews A8_ENDPOINT_TYPE "http"
cf set-env books-reviews A8_PROXY "true"
cf set-env books-reviews A8_REGISTER "true"
cf set-env books-reviews A8_REGISTRY_URL "http://registry.bosh-lite.com"
cf set-env books-reviews A8_CONTROLLER_URL "http://controller.bosh-lite.com"
cf start books-reviews
```

Allow the Products app the ability to talk to the Reviews app:
```sh
cf access-allow books-products books-reviews --port 9080 --protocol tcp
```

## Deploy Book Ratings app

You may either run this script:
```sh
./scripts/deploy-ratings.sh
```

OR if you wish to deploy by hand
```sh
cf push books-ratings-o amalgam8/a8-examples-bookinfo-ratings-sidecar:v1 --no-start --no-route
cf set-env books-ratings A8_SERVICE "ratings:v1"
cf set-env books-ratings A8_ENDPOINT_PORT "9080"
cf set-env books-ratings A8_ENDPOINT_TYPE "http"
cf set-env books-ratings A8_PROXY "true"
cf set-env books-ratings A8_REGISTER "true"
cf set-env books-ratings A8_REGISTRY_URL "http://registry.bosh-lite.com"
cf set-env books-ratings A8_CONTROLLER_URL "http://controller.bosh-lite.com"
cf start books-ratings
```

Allow the Reviews app the ability to talk to the Ratings app:
```sh
cf access-allow books-reviews books-ratings --port 9080 --protocol tcp
```

## Check Apps
After deploying you should see the controller, registry and products apps with routes. The reviews, details and ratings apps will not have external routes.
```sh
$ cf apps
Getting apps in org demo / space demo as admin...
OK

name               requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
books-controller   started           1/1         256M     1G     books-controller.bosh-lite.com
books-details      started           1/1         256M     1G
books-ratings      started           1/1         256M     1G
books-reviews      started           1/1         256M     1G
books-registry     started           1/1         256M     1G     books-registry.bosh-lite.com
books-products     started           1/1         256M     1G     books-products.bosh-lite.com
```

## Check Network Policy
The above scripts/commands will create the appropriate network policy to ensure that only appropriate apps can talk to each other.
```sh
$ cf access-list
Listing policies as admin...
OK

Source          Destination     Protocol        Port
books-products  books-details   tcp             9080
books-products  books-reviews   tcp             9080
books-reviews   books-ratings   tcp             9080
```

## Check Service Registry
At this point we have our apps deployed and we should be able to see them registered in the service registry. The IP address and ports that the applications registered are the internal CF Container Networking overlay addresses.

```sh
curl -s books-registry.bosh-lite.com/api/v1/instances | jq .
```
